I've been working on a ROBLOX game across the span of three days (Aug 23 - Aug 25, but most of the work was done in two).
The game is titled **[King of the Kings of the Hill](https://www.roblox.com/games/139404174858131/King-of-the-King-of-the-Hills)**. Sounds exciting, I know.

It's been *Homework Simulator*-while (around Summer of 2020) since I've coded a ROBLOX game, so the whole process was refreshing. This time, I dove back into the ROBLOX library and used some new features, as well as tried using AI to accelerate the development process.

Right off the bat, the most impressive AI tool that I used was actually not on the platform. The thumbnail you see above was generated by [Bing's Image Creator](https://www.bing.com/images/create), powered by DALL-E 3. It's free, you can use it for commercial use - what more can you ask for!
