title: Yet Another ROBLOX Game Dev Summer

I've been working on a ROBLOX game across the span of three days (Aug 23 - Aug 25, but most of the work was done in two).
The game is titled **[King of the Kings of the Hill](https://www.roblox.com/games/139404174858131/King-of-the-King-of-the-Hills)**. Sounds fun, I know.

It's been *Homework Simulator*-while (Summer of 2020) since I've coded a ROBLOX game, so the whole process was refreshing. This time, I dove back into the ROBLOX library and used some new features, as well as tried using AI to accelerate the development process. Part-thanks to AI tooling, I managed to complete the game in such a short period of time.


## AI Tools
### Image Generation


      <img id="carousel" alt="thumbnail" src="https://tr.rbxcdn.com/00d26a1bb5478cb552116673b5a81240/768/432/Image/Webp"/>

Right off the bat, the most impressive AI tool that I used was actually not on the platform. The thumbnail you see above was generated by [Bing's Image Creator](https://www.bing.com/images/create), powered by DALL-E 3. It's free, you can use it for commercial use - what more can you ask for! I managed to create 5~6 thumbnails with different styles and icons, which was helpful when A/B testing for CTR when running ads for the game. The images were high quality and generating them was $0.

This is the biggest win for me, because doing this myself/hiring someone else to do it for the same quality would have taken a significantly longer period of time. It also helps that since the contents displayed in the image aren't specifically infringing on someone's art style (as they're just 3D rendered ROBLOX-esque characters) that I feel OK using them.


### ROBLOX Code Assist

The next thing that propelled my development was ROBLOX's built in code assistant. Having to code in ROBLOX's own IDE, their code assist feature helps you fill in very basic logic, but is still far from the capabilities that is currently available in the industry currently.

I think there's a lot of potential here if ROBLOX tries to integrate this with the game context. There are a lot of objects and properties that programmers have to interact with (e.g. the bricks players walk on, logic for jump pads, etc.) that directly relate to the game. If ROBLOX can integrate this context, I imagine the code assistant to be significantly more powerful.

## Actually Marketing The Game
Having said that, a game isn't complete without it's players.

it has been a while since I have marketed a game on ROBLOX. I've been out of the loop for a while, and it seems like they've introduced the new Roblox Ads Systemâ„¢. You put in ad credits to 'bid' for impressions, and pray that your game gets a lot of clicks.

I've been running ads for the game for a few days now with different strategies after scouring the forums, but it seems like my measely budget of ~$15USD is insufficient to get more than 3 concurrent players in the game at one time, even with "OK" click through rate (CTR) and play rate.

## The Stats
Looking at the statistics, it seems like whenever players join the game, they stay for ~2-3 minutes even with no other players in the game, **despite it being a PVP game!** I think this is because I added a system that gives you free in-game currency after 3 minutes, which is a good incentive to stay in the game.Whenever there's actually players in the game (read: >4 people in the server), the average play time shoots up to almost 6 minutes! This is a good sign to me that the game is actually fun *if I can get enough players to start a server*.

For now, however, I'll have to unfortunately put launching the game on hold until I find a better strategy to get more players in the game without putting a hole through my wallet.
