title: Yet Another ROBLOX Game Summer

I've been working on a ROBLOX game across the span of three days (Aug 23 - Aug 25, but most of the work was done in two).
The game is titled **"King of the King of the Hill"**. Sounds exciting, I know.

This article is currently just a placeholder to ensure that this blog thing I made isn't completely broken.
I'll be writing a little more about the game shortly.
