This time, I dove back into the ROBLOX library and used some new features, as well as tried using AI to accelerate the development process.

It’s free, you can use it for commercial use - what more can you ask for!

The images were high quality and generating them was $0.',P,c,J="This is the biggest win for me, because doing this myself/hiring someone else to do it for the same quality would have taken a significantly longer period of time.

There are a lot of objects and properties that programmers have to interact with (e.g. the bricks players walk on, logic for jump pads, etc.) that directly relate to the game.
